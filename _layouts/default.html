                  <p class="text-faded">T4$ came about because I saw the need to help struggling learners.  I tutored tirelessly and relentlessly for free for a number of years. I had a client who was working on a second graduate degree.  The degree was in Healthcare Management.  I did not know anything about Healthcare Management, but I knew how to tutor. As a result of my tutoring, my client learned two very valuable lessons.  The first was how to study.  The second was that he could be a good student.  From those lessons T4$ was created.   </p>

                        Through research and personal experience I found a large percentage of students do not know how to study.  Furthermore, they do not understand the learning process. Our present education system enables struggling learners to make excuses for failure rather than give them tools for success.  The T4$ system helps students identify their weaknesses, identify the learning style that works best for them and bridges the gap between a struggling learner and an empowered learner.
T4$ teaches the strategies of successful learning.  Successful learning is a process.  The T4$ system captures some of the most effective tutoring strategies and study tips to bridge the gap between a struggling learner and an empowered learner.
Most of us were never taught to study.  Even when we were, it was by someone who did not understand the learning process.  We practiced memorizing rather than mastering the subject matter. As a result of poor practice we perpetuate poor habits. Just as tutoring is a process, so is studying.  T4$ focuses on strategies and learning modalities in order to master subject matter as opposed to memorizing topics. </p>

<p>I am a native of Columbus, Ohio. I graduated from Northland High School in 1982. I entered the United States Air Force in 1982 and was trained as a Czechoslovak linguist. I was stationed in Augsburg, Germany and worked as Crypto-logic Linguist Specialist. I later became an advanced Crypto-logic Linguist Specialist. Later, I became an Airborne Linguist, flying aboard the EC-130H. After the Warsaw Pact disbanded I retrained as an Intelligence Analyst. After 12 years in the Intelligence field I was selected to become an Air Force Recruiter. As an Air Force Recruiter I earned the distinction of being selected as one of the top 10 recruiters in the Air Force. Upon my retirement in 2002, I decided to pursue my true passion, becoming an educator. I returned to school and completed my undergraduate degree in Interdisciplinary Studies. Immediately after student teaching I was hired as a Title I tutor. I then moved into teaching second grade and later kindergarten. I am certified in the state of Texas as an EC-4 Generalist, Special Education EC-12, ESL EC-12 and Reading Specialist EC-12. TLI coach in the San Antonio Independent School District.</p>                </div>
